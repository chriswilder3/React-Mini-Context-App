# React Mini Context App : ThemeSwitcher

## Note : 
  These are a set of React Apps built as part of learning Context APIs during course. Note that code has been made simpler, as I have used intuitive naming, symbols and a ton of explainations. 
  Feel free to use them for studying. Particularly this one is known as ThemeSwitcher app.
